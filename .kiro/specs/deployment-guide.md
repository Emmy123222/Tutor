# TutorBot Deployment Guide

## Production Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] OpenAI API key added
- [ ] Build process tested locally
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] TypeScript compilation successful

### Vercel Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Connect Repository**
   - Link GitHub repository to Vercel
   - Configure automatic deployments

2. **Environment Variables**
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_production_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-domain.vercel.app
   ```

3. **Build Settings**
   - Framework: Next.js
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `.next`

### Performance Optimization

#### Frontend
- Static generation for landing page
- Image optimization with Next.js Image component
- CSS minification and compression
- Code splitting for better loading

#### Backend
- API route optimization
- Response caching for common topics
- Error boundary implementation
- Rate limiting for API calls

#### AI Integration
- Token usage monitoring
- Response caching for repeated topics
